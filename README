Designed for checking if the GLPI email receiver is working correctly.

Would likely work with any helpdesk/ticket system.

Sends an email with a unique string to a specified email address (e.g. helpdesk@yourdomain)
Waits a specified amount of time
Checks an IMAP account to see if a confirmation email with the same unique string was received
Writes success status to a file (which can be checked using Nagios or similar)
